Things to consider:

- What specific challenges are you aiming to solve:
- The literacy rate for Birmingham and Leicester children are below the national average. BAME communities are impacted in particular by this with KS2 children in Leicester consisting of asian, black and other ethnicities having a significant gap in reading, writing and maths in 2023 compared to the national average. There are also similar stats for children in Birmingham


- How does your solution address the challenge(s) of the targeted users, how is AI integerated into it:
- Our solution will specialise on ensuring that the fundmental building blocks that every child needs like reading, writing and mathematics can be taught flexibly forgoing the rigid and outdated methods that are leaving children behind. AI will be a key component in this to make it flexible. If a child is stuck on a specific problem, it can explain it in different ways or even adjust the content to relate the problem to a concept the child likes (i.e. Minecraft). Making the content more engaging and therefore improving their educational outcome by making learning fun.

- Tangible outputs to demonstrate how the solution works:
- Ideally we want to use a sanitised version of GPT-4o to demonstrate how this would work in practice.
- However, as a fallback, we could use a rule based chatbot as a prototype to see how an ideal interaction would work.

Points- 1 point for AI use
        3 points for insightful questions.
        5 points for correct answer

points can be used to purchase things such as pets etc.

- Challenges/risks:
- Might be some pushback rolling it out as it effectively carries out the roles that an assistant teacher would be doing
- Model would need to be heavily sanitised to ensure it does not output inappropiate text/words for children
- Children might be hesitant to learn from something that isn't human.
